## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### PROBLEM OR ISSUE
College event organizers currently use manual methods for tracking attendance and collecting participant feedback, which are inefficient, error-prone, and delay results.

### PURPOSE OF PROJECT
The purpose of this project is to develop an easy-to-use digital system that collects real-time attendance and feedback for college events, enabling faster, more accurate reporting for organizers and improved engagement measurement.

### BUSINESS CASE
This project minimizes manual paperwork and errors, delivering operational cost reduction and timelier insights into student engagement. Revenue increases will result from better event marketing and sponsor targeting due to more accurate data. Estimated ROI is achieved within one academic year, with a payback period of less than 8 months.

### GOALS / METRICS
- **Achieve 90% digital attendance capture** for all campus events in the first semester
- **Generate event insights report within 2 days** post-event, instead of the current 2 weeks
- **Increase post-event feedback participation by 40%**

### EXPECTED DELIVERABLES
- **Phase 1**: Mobile digital attendance app (iOS/Android)
- **Phase 2**: Web-based reporting dashboard
- **Documentation**: Risk management plan, resource/cost plan, communication plan, requirements report, final summary report
- **Training Materials**: User manuals and organizer training sessions
